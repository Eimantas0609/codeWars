Your function also receives a third argument, a string, with the name of the fighter that attacks first.

Example:
  declare_winner(Fighter("Lew", 10, 2), Fighter("Harry", 5, 4), "Lew") => "Lew"
  
  Lew attacks Harry; Harry now has 3 health.
  Harry attacks Lew; Lew now has 6 health.
  Lew attacks Harry; Harry now has 1 health.
  Harry attacks Lew; Lew now has 2 health.
  Lew attacks Harry: Harry now has -1 health and is dead. Lew wins.
function Fighter(name, health, damagePerAttack) {
        this.name = name;
        this.health = health;
        this.damagePerAttack = damagePerAttack;
        this.toString = function() { return this.name; }
}
